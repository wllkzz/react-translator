This project is a simple web application built using the React library that allows users to search for definitions and pronunciation of English words. The application provides access to an extensive database of words and their meanings using the Dictionary API. It also provides the ability to listen to the pronunciation of the word if available.

The main functions are:
1. Word Entry: Users can enter English words in the search text box.

2. Meaning search: When users click on the "Meaning" button, the app sends a query to the dictionary API and displays definitions and synonyms for the entered word.

3. Pronunciation: If a pronunciation for the word is available, users can tap the "Play" button to listen to the pronunciation of the word.

4. Modal window: If there is no audio pronunciation available for a word, the app displays a modal window with information about the pronunciation not being available.

5. Error Handling: The application handles errors and notifies the user if there are problems when requesting the API.
